# Homework 3

Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of September 18 at midnight 

## Instructions
The homework pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Your written work should be in the form of a pdf, and the pdf should be titled `HW3.pdf`. Use an app like Scannable or Genius Scan to convert your images to black and white to hugely cut down on the size of the created pdf. 
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository. 
 - [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository. 


#### Testing
This is a tough assignment to have auto-tests for, as the second problem is heavily random and the last problem is very qualitative. If I can figure out some tests for the secnod problem, I'll go ahead and add them, but you might be on your own to make sure you have followed the instructions properly for this homework.
