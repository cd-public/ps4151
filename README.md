Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of February 14 at midnight (so romantic, I know...)

## Instructions
The homework pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Your written work should be in the form of a pdf, and the pdf should be titled `HW3.pdf`. Use an app like Scannable or Genius Scan to convert your images to black and white to hugely cut down on the size of the created pdf. 
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository. 
 - [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository. 


#### Testing
Problem 2, 3 all have around 4-5 tests each. Several of these are checking the examples shown in the text and others are checking other pieces of your submission. Be sure to check them for information on if you are missing something!
