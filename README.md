## Instructions
The homework pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Problem 1 is in 3 parts, with three different scripts that need fixing
 	- Full descriptions of what each program is supposed to do are on the pdf
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository. 
 - [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository. 


#### Testing
Owing to the flexible nature of the first problem, the random nature of the second problem and the purely visual nature of the 3rd problem, I can't easily make tests for those problems, so you are on your own to ensure they are working as intended!
